RISC-Assembler-and-Simulator

● This Python-based assembler is designed to accept an assembly code as input and
generate an executable binary file based on IEEE 754 format, which also plots the
section of memory/registers being accessed.

● Accessed memory / registers are also plotted against the cycles to see if any loops
occur in the given instructions.

● Used Concepts like Compilers Design, Computer Architecture, Memory Access.
